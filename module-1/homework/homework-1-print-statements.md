# Homework 1 - Working with print statement
First we need to create the directory to hold all files and directories we will need for the Python Fundamentals class

## Creating the Directory for the class
1. create the top directory by typing the below command in your terminal and hit enter

   `mkdir python-fundamentals`

2. switch to the above directory you just created

   `cd python-fundamentals`

3. create another directory in the python-fundamentals directory

   `mkdir module-1`

4. Now switch to the module-1 directory

   `cd module-1`

5. if you check your present working deircetory, you should be in `python-fundamentals/module-1/`

## Writing your first program
1. create a new file in the `python-fundamentals/module-1/` directory

   `touch myfirstprogram.py`
2. open this file in vs code and type the following code

   `print ("Hello world")`
3. In your terminal, use the python interpreter to run your source file. Make sure to run this command in the right directory.

   `python myfirstprogram.py`

**The above was what we did together in class. If you didn't follow along I recommend you do it all over again to get a good hang of it.**

### Tasks
Create a file for each task

1. write a program that print the following multiple pieces of data on the same line - **76, 5001, 3.142, "Hello World", True**
2.  write a program that print the following pieces of data on multiple lines - **Knock knock., Who's there?, Interrupting cow. Interrupting cow wh-MOO!**
3.  copy the following lines of code into a file and add a comment to predict what the lines of code will do
    ```python
       print (50, end=" ")
       print (1000)
    ```
4. Using the print statement create the following triangle (Bonus: try to minimize the number of print statement you use) - 
   ```
   #
   ##
   ###
   ####
   #####
   ######
   #######
   ```
5. using a print statement create the following (Bonus: try to minimize the number of print statement you use) - 
   ```
           *
          * *
         *   *
        *     *
       ***   ***
         *   *
         *   *
         *****
   ```
